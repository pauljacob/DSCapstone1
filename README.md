# NBA Game Score Difference Prediction

*In this project, we attempt to predict the spread of NBA games to provide the data point of a good model for retail NBA sportsbook bettors. We do this using a random forest regression model for spread. Using a simple betting policy for the 6-month 2017-18 regular season, we find our model correctly predicts at a rate of 68% and has an ROI of 11%.*

*Basketball is the third most popular sport for betting on globally. Of basketball leagues, the NBA is the most bet on. There are a variety of strategies used by NBA sports bettors in attempting to turn a profit. One strategy is called subjective handicapping where a point compensation is made for the team favorite/underdog. Other strategies include finding microholds, 0% holds, or negative holds in synthetic markets.*

*Using the team stat, team lost contribution, and GDP datasets, we predicted NBA game spread with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 9.7. Using confidence intervals for spread and betting data, a simple betting policy is made. Metrics such as betting accuracy, ROI, and risk of bankruptcy are observed.*

## 1. Data

Three data sources are used to aggregate a dataset for the NBA game spread prediction on the 2010-11 thru 2017-18 seasons: nba_api, Kaggle, and Wikipedia. Below, our data sources are further described by feature groups.


> * Team Stats: [nba_api Team Advanced Stats Dataset](https://github.com/swar/nba_api), [Kaggle Game Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nathanlauga/nba-games?select=games.csv), [Kaggle Boxscore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ehallmar/nba-historical-stats-and-betting-data?select=nba_games_all.csv), [Kaggle Team Name-Abbreviation Dataset1](https://www.kaggle.com/nathanlauga/nba-games?select=teams.csv), [Kaggle Team Name-Abbreviation Dataset2](https://www.kaggle.com/gabrielmanfredi/nba-retro-1995-to-2000-full-basketball-datasets)


> * Team Lost Contribution: [nba_api Player Advanced Stats Dataset](https://github.com/swar/nba_api), [Kaggle Injury Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ghopkins/nba-injuries-2010-2018), [Kaggle Inactive Player Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wyattowalsh/basketball) 


> * GDP: [Wikipedia U.S. Metropolitan Area GDP Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._metropolitan_areas_by_GDP), [Wikipedia City GDP Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_GDP)


> * Betting: [Kaggle Betting Spread Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ehallmar/nba-historical-stats-and-betting-data?select=nba_betting_spread.csv)


## 2. Method

Our objective was to determine whether to place a bet on an NBA game or not. The ramifications in attempting to answer this question led us to decide between the following models:


1. Build a regression model for predicting spread. Then build a simple policy for betting on NBA games (to return accuracy and ROI).

2. Build a classification model for predicting winning and losing bets.

Because the regression model gave us more granularity, interpretability, and the option to create a confidence interval of predictions, the regression model was favored over the classification model.



## 3. Data Cleaning 

In this project, we selected the 2010-11 thru 2017-18 seasons for prediction. This is because of our datasets and features, these seasons were in common. Below, we describe some of the data cleaning process.

* **Problem 1:** NBA player names were sometimes not consistent with a team, date, or league. Also, names were sometimes different between the injury, inactive player,  and advanced stats datasets. We wanted the player-level stats to create ‘lost contribution’ features. While cleaning this player name data manually was done, many of these players did not show up in our top features for predictive importance. Maybe In the future, the less impactful players can be ignored.

* **Problem 2:** Game Stats contained game id’s with estimated game dates and conflicted with other the boxscore dataset game dates. Preference was given to the boxscore dataset with fewer missing dates and were not stated as estimates.

* **Problem 3:** Team names were not consistent across datasets and team city, name, or abbreviates sometimes changed between seasons. We wanted to create team matchup stats that were easy to interpret without having to memorize team_id. Team abbreviation was determined as the easiest human readable team identifier.

## 5. Algorithms & Machine Learning


Random Forest Regression was used from the scikit-learn library and performed the best among Gradient Boosting and Select K-best Linear Regression. In addition, the Random Forest Regression scikit-learn library provided Gini importance per feature which allowed us to narrow our 800+ features to under 100.

>***NOTE:** Here, the first 90% of games were used to predict the last 10% of games. Also, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is the criterion used in our Random Forest Regression model. Preference is given to the MAE metric because we want the number of points away our predicted spread is from the actual spread and to minimize it.*



**WINNER: Random Forest Regressor**

grid_params = {<br />
        'randomforestregressor__n_estimators': [200],<br />
        'randomforestregressor__max_depth': [10],<br />
        'randomforestregressor__min_samples_split': [100]<br />
}


## 6. How “Good” Is Our Model?


In comparing our MAE to that of the sportsbooks, we achieved an MAE of 9.7 while that of the book was 9.3. Knowing that we did not beat the sportsbook model metric MAE, we were forced to ask how useful is a seemingly inferior model?

To answer this, we decided to make a simple betting policy that attempted to give a good ROI while minimizing risk. One of the features we created for this task is the confidence interval for predicted spread. This was done by taking the bootstrap n=8 mean of Random Forest decision tree predictions. Below is an example spread distribution for an NBA game.

In addition to the spread confidence interval, we created sportsbook betting features  price break even and the absolute value of spread.



## 7. Betting Policy

Taking our three new features, we ran combinations of them as betting policy criteria from and on folds 1 thru 7. We collected the top performing policy criteria which turned out to be 5%. The most frequently occurring criterion values were selected and checked for performance on fold 8.

## 8. Betting Policy Outcomes


Using the same process for betting policy selection on folds 1 thru 8, the same was done on folds 1 thru 8 and checked on fold 9. The results below show that by adjusting the betting size, we adjusted our risk tolerance. From left to right we have a risk tolerance of 5, 2, and 1, where 5 is the maximum losing streak on the train folds 1 thru 8 as a percentage of the total initial number of bets available.

## 9. Future Improvements

* While in hyperparameter tuning, 5-fold cross-validation produced a “good” model, time series cross-validation would be more suited for a production model. This is because it avoids the potential overfitting of using future data to predict past data. 

* Also, adding more features like names of game officials and quarter by quarter stats could give more insight into the random forest model and potentially yield a better MAE.

* While selecting a simple betting policy was done as a heuristic, exploring potential machine learning solutions may help if going beyond a simple policy is desired.
